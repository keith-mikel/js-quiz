# JavaScrip Quiz Challenge 4

This project is a Quiz that will test your knowledge on JavaScript, it was made in efforts to work on javascript logic when it comes to things such as functions, element selection, intervals and how they can be used together to make an interactive website. The main features of this quiz is that along with the use of the HTML and CSS the javascript can change these documents to be dynamic, such as the questions changing which is a result of the actual HTML elements being edited with the logic. Please enjoy and test your knowledge!

## Usage

This Javascript test can be used to see not only how much you know about javascript but also to see the dynamic changes on a webpage that can be created with javascript. Notice how the questions change based on the user interaction, as well as a response is generated based on if the users answer is correct or not. Also the use of local storage and event listeners is used to make the page able to react to user interaction and store the data from it!
